> üëã **Welcome to this lab project!**
>
> üõ† **What is it?**  
> This is a servlet and JSP-based web application implemented following the `MVC pattern`.
>
> üéØ **Purpose of the Website**  
> To determine if a point falls within a specified area on the coordinate plane üòé
>
> ---
>
> üìå **Key Features**
>
> - üñ• Users can easily input data through an **HTML page with a web form**, generated by a `JSP page`.
> - üìä The `servlets.AreaCheckServlet` is then used to check if the point falls within the specified area.
> - üîí With `JavaScript`, I ensure data integrity by performing `validation` on user input.

## Requirements for Variant `11117312`

| ![Area Diagram](https://github.com/worthant/MVC-GeoValidator/assets/43885024/625ac219-2029-432d-8080-f23ddcb4ead4) |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|

### Goal: Development of a Web Application using *Servlets* and *JSP*

#### üìã Core Components (following MVC pattern):

- [x] `servlets.ControllerServlet`: Identifies the type of request and delegates its processing to one of the components
  listed below, if the request contains information about the coordinates of the point and the radius. All requests
  within the application should be forwarded to this servlet using `POST`.
- [x] `servlets.AreaCheckServlet`: Checks if the point falls within the area and generates an HTML page with the
  results. Should handle all requests that contain information about the coordinates of the point and the radius of the
  area.
- [x] `JSP Page`: Generates an HTML page with a web form for data input and a diagram. Should handle all requests that
  do not contain information about the coordinates of the point and the radius of the area.

#### üé® The JSP Page should include:

1. [x] Header: Full name, group number, variant number.
2. [x] Form: Sends data to the server.
3. [x] Set of fields: For specifying the coordinates of the point and the radius of the area according to the assignment
   variant.
4. [x] Validation: JavaScript script to validate the data entered into the form.
5. [x] üü† Interactive Element:
    - [x] With a set radius, clicking on the image sends the coordinates to the server.
    - [x] Otherwise, displays a warning.
    - [x] Refreshes the diagram after checking for a hit.
    - [x] Responsive diagram: Redraws all points depending on whether they fall within the area or not upon radius
      change.
6. [x] Table of results from previous checks. The list of results should be retrieved from a `Bean component`.

#### üìä The page returned by servlets.AreaCheckServlet should include:

1. [x] Table containing the received parameters.
2. [x] Computation Results: Hit / Miss.
3. [x] Link to the web form for a new request (if you have one page instead of two, do nothing).

#### üåê Deployment:

- [x] The developed web application must be deployed on a `WildFly` server in standalone configuration. Ports should be
  configured according to the provided `portbase`, and access to the http listener should be open for all IPs.

## Topics for Lab Defense Preparation

1. [x] Java servlets. Implementation features, key methods, advantages and disadvantages compared to CGI and FastCGI.
2. [x] Servlet containers. Servlet lifecycle.
3. [x] Request dispatching in servlets. Servlet filters.
4. [x] HTTP sessions - purpose, how servlets interact with the session, methods of session ID transmission.
5. [x] Servlet context - purpose, how servlets interact with the context.
6. [x] JavaServer Pages. Features, advantages and disadvantages compared to servlets, application areas.
7. [x] JSP lifecycle.
8. [x] Structure of a JSP page. Comments, directives, declarations, scriptlets, and expressions.
9. [x] Rules for writing Java code within JSP. Standard variables accessible in scriptlets and expressions.
10. [x] Bean components and their usage in JSP.
11. [x] Standard JSP tags. Using Expression Language (EL) in JSP.
12. [x] JSP configuration parameters in web application deployment descriptor.
13. [x] Design patterns and architectural patterns. Usage in web applications.
14. [x] Web application architecture. MVC pattern. Architectural models Model 1 and Model 2 and their implementation on
    the Java EE platform.

## How to Deploy *Your* Lab on Helios to Make it Work?

1. Download Wildfly version 21 (LGPL) from here: https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/#21.0.0.Final
2. Unpack and upload the archive to Helios (Yes, all 200 megabytes)

> [How to Connect and Upload Files to Helios](https://github.com/Imtjl/1st-year-guide#Connection)

3. In `~/wildfly/wildfly-21.0.0.Final/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`, change:

> Just `vim standalone.xml`, then press `i` for `insert` and edit. To save and exit vim, press `Esc` and
> type `:wq`

```xml
<interface name="public">
    <inet-address value="${jboss.bind.address:127.0.0.1}"/>
</interface>
```

to

```xml
<interface name="public">
    <any-address/>
</interface>
```

---

Further Task:

- Change the default port to your `portbase`.
- IMPORTANT! Change all other ports so that there are no errors (`already in use`, etc.) when the server starts.

> As soon as I changed all the ports - all my servlets became visible and the server started working, before that I
> settled for 404

```xml
<socket-binding name="http" port="${jboss.http.port:8080}"/>
<socket-binding name="https" port="${jboss.https.port:443}"/>
        ...
        ...
```

to

```xml
<socket-binding name="http" port="${jboss.http.port:<portbase>}"/>
```

! where **portbase** - a number from the Google journal, you can also add 1 to 99 to it, because portbase is given assuming
that 99 ports following it are also yours.

For example, my portbase is `32318`. It is given assuming that 99 ports following it are also mine, so I wrote any ports
greater than 32318 by 1-99 and my `standalone.xml` turned out to be:

```xml
<socket-binding name="ajp" port="${jboss.ajp.port:32319}"/>
<socket-binding name="http" port="${jboss.http.port:32318}"/>
<socket-binding name="https" port="${jboss.https.port:32320}"/>
<socket-binding name="management-http" interface="management" port="${jboss.management.http.port:32321}"/>
<socket-binding name="management-https" interface="management" port="${jboss.management.https.port:32322}"/> 
```

4. Connect to helios, forwarding ports using the command:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 s******@se.ifmo.ru -L <portbase>:helios.cs.ifmo.ru:<portbase>
```

> The ssh command's -L argument means that the port on the local host should be forwarded to the specified host and port on the remote side.

5. Start the server:

```bash
bash ~/wildfly/wildfly-21.0.0.Final/bin/standalone.sh
```

6. Navigate to the URL in the browser: http://localhost:8080/war_name.

## Guide for using my lab

- Deploy on Helios, forward the ports to yourself.

You can enter my s368090:

```bash
ssh s368090@se.ifmo.ru -p 2222
```

Run standalone.sh:

```bash
bash ~/wildfly/wildfly-21.0.0.Final/bin/standalone.sh
```

And forward the ports (in another terminal) as follows:

```bash
ssh -L 32318:localhost:32318 s368090@se.ifmo.ru -p 2222
```

Now open in the browser: http://localhost:32318/MVC-GeoValidator/ (or any other port that you have forwarded)

  <summary>Operational Recommendations</summary>

- **Lab Functionality**: Play with the points on the graph. Points will appear green or red depending on hits.
- **Validation**: Full data validation is performed on both the client and server side.
- **Additional Info**: The lab follows AJAX principles. Each server request adds a row to the table in the Bean, which is then filled using table.jsp.
